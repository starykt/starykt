- 👋 Well, I'm @starykt (nickname based on the infinity skye that I love so much).
- 👀 I’m interested in being one of those look-alike professionals.
- 👩‍💻 I'm graduating as a developer, but my heart beats for design and games.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning C#, Python and PHP (as well as game-related concepts such as Unreal Ungine 5 and 3DS Max).
- 💞️ I'm looking for an internship to improve my skills.
